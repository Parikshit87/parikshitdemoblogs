I am a technical writer and content strategist by profession. Currently learning Python coding and leadership skills. I am an avid learner of new tools and technologies and spend time by learning and surfing the Internet. Other than that, I am a big fan of motorcycling and ride my motorcycle whenever I have some time to ride freely.


Would love to collaborate!
