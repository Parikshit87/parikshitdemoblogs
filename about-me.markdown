I strated as a Technical Support Engineer, then transitioned into Business Analysis, Technical Writing, Content Management Analytics and recently working as a Product Management cum Program Management professional. Recently completed my Executive MBA after graduating almost a decade back post my engineering degree. 

Currently learning Python coding and leadership skills. I am an avid learner of new tools and technologies and spend time by learning and surfing the Internet. Other than that, I am a big fan of motorcycling and ride my motorcycle whenever I have some time to ride freely.


Would love to collaborate!
