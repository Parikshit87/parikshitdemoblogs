The options for building a website include website builders and content management systems (CMS). They provide templates to design your site and require you to pay for hosting.

The other option is to build your own content management system. But that may not be worth the time and effort for a small project. If you just need a site to show off your portfolio of projects or start a blog, you can use Jekyll to build the site and hosting it online for free using GitHub pages. Here, Jekyll is the static site builder that ensures you can create static sites like blog posts and so on easily without digging deeper much into content management system and their intricacies.
